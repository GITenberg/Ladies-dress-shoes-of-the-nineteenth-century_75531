<p class="c lsp large">Preface.</p>


<p class="n"><span class="smcap large">The</span> sixty-three ladies’ shoes now illustrated have all belonged to and been
worn by ladies of the 19th century. They have been most carefully selected to
illustrate the variety and change of fashion during that period. The shoes
can be copied in any material by any shoemaker. I beg to return thanks to
all those who have been so kind as to give me their assistance in collecting
them.</p>

<div class="pad">

<span class="smcap">Glencarse</span>,<br>
<span class="more"><i>28th May 1900</i>.</span>
</p></div>


<p class="c lsp large p2">Frontispiece.</p>

<p class="n"><span class="smcap large">This</span> specimen of Mule or Bedroom Slipper is in green velvet, on which
the coat of arms is embroidered in rich silk and metallic threads. The front
is finished off with a white silk ruche, held in place with a row of narrow gold
braid, and the lower outline softened with an edging of fine blonde lace. The
heel is covered with royal blue satin, and the lining is white. The maker is
Abrahams, Westbourne Grove, W.</p>


<p class="c lsp large p2">Plate I.</p>

<p class="n"><span class="smcap large">We</span> have in this illustration three fine specimens of the modern shoemaker’s
craft. The general shape of the shoes is much the same, but what may be
called the decoration is varied. The satisfactory use of the “Magpie” colours
is striking, and argues the good taste of the worker, and the designs, though
simple, give scope to great excellence in workmanship.</p>

<p class="n">The cordonnier artist has apparently considered his lines as carefully as
the best of yacht builders. The material employed in the first two instances
is kid, and in the other black and white velvet.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig2.jpg" alt="shoes">
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Plate i.</span></p>
</div>


<p class="c lsp large p2">Plate II.</p>

<p class="n"><span class="smcap large">Illustrates</span> three black satin shoes. The first, without heel and very square
toe, was, no doubt, comfortable, but decidedly unshapely foot-gear. The sole
is thin, and there is no attempt at ornamentation, even to hide the elastic
ankle strap. As this shoe dates back a considerable number of years, it serves
to show the many modern improvements of its two companions.</p>

<p class="n">No. 2 has a general appearance, which at once demands admiration.
The heel is medium, the toe pointed, and the ornament is a trefoil in old
paste. This shoe belonged to Mrs Macandrew of Dalcross Castle, N.B.,
who may be congratulated on its size, or, rather, want of size, and on the good
taste which chooses a plainness of style embodying the essence of smartness.
The Jubilee Shoe has Louis heel, and is embroidered with the Royal Crown
and initials, V.R., with motto, “God save the Queen.” This shoe was
designed in honour of Her Majesty’s first Jubilee, 1887. In 1897 a similar
shoe appeared with the Crown, date, and wording, “Sixty Years Celebration.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig3.jpg" alt="shoes">
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Plate ii.</span></p>
</div>


<p class="c lsp large p2">Plate III.</p>

<p class="n"><span class="smcap large">Bronze</span> stage shoe worn by the well-known actress Miss Ada Cavendish.
Louis heel, somewhat square toe, embroidered finely with steel, and large
brown satin-pleated bow with steel buckle.</p>

<p class="n">Bronze shoe No. 2 is one of the smallest in the collection, and belonged
to Miss Marsh. It has a pointed toe, Louis heel, and plain little bow of
brown satin ribbon.</p>

<p class="n">The third shoe, also in bronze, has very pointed toe, with pearl and gold
embroidery, which also adorns the small bow, leaf-like in form. The side
seam is stitched with silk galloon, similar to what binds the outside edge.
The heel is Louis in style.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig4.jpg" alt="shoes">
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Plate iii.</span></p>
</div>


<p class="c lsp large p2">Plate IV.</p>

<p class="n"><span class="smcap large">This</span> elegant shoe resembles a little its immediate predecessor in Plate III. in
the heel, bow with four small leaves, and the ribbon-covered side seam, and,
indeed, reflects the style of the same maker, with the difference shown in the
embroidery, which completely covers the pointed toe, and is of rich gold
thread. Gold beads further enhance the bow. The kid is bronze.</p>

<p class="n">Bronze also No. 2, with interlaced yellow ribbon in diamond pattern.
This design of stitched ribbon is a good idea to make a self-coloured shoe
correspond more closely with costumes in mixed hues. The round ornament
is gilt, and the heel an ordinary one.</p>

<p class="n">The next shoe is in black glacé kid, and belonged to the late Duchesse
d’Aumâle. The toe is square, Louis heel, and the “ruched” rosette is of
black silk, edged with puce.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig5.jpg" alt="shoes">
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Plate iv.</span></p>
</div>


<p class="c lsp large p2">Plate V.</p>

<p class="n">No. 1.—Pink kid shoe, with round toe, ordinary heel, and lined white kid.
The knot-bow is in pink silk ribbon, with picot edge.</p>

<p class="n">The late Marchioness of Ely owned the centre shoe. It is in rich pink
satin, ornamented with round real lace rosette, and has Louis heel and square
toe.</p>

<p class="n">Plain pink satin shoe—the 3rd—very neat in shape, with ordinary heel,
and trimmed small bow of same pink satin as the shoe.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig6.jpg" alt="shoes">
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Plate v.</span></p>
</div>


<p class="c lsp large p2">Plate VI.</p>

<p class="n"><span class="smcap large">Here</span> appears another of Miss Ada Cavendish’s shoes, worn on the stage.
It is of bright yellow satin, trimmed silver braid, which mingles also with the
satin in the round rosette, with mother-of-pearl centre. The toe is very square,
this actress being slow to adopt the pointed toe now so much in vogue.</p>

<p class="n">No. 2, yellow satin shoe, has silk embroidery, studded with orange-tinted
cabochons, and the bow of crimson silk gives an uncommon finish.
Pointed toe and ordinary heel.</p>

<p class="n">The third is of plain straw-coloured satin, made uncompromisingly to
match costume without further decoration than the bow, formed of the same
material.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig7.jpg" alt="shoes">
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Plate vi.</span></p>
</div>


<p class="c lsp large p2">Plate VII.</p>

<p class="n"><span class="smcap large">Single</span> strap shoe, in French grey satin, the front in a certain manner
unattached from back, and distinguished from the same by elaborate floral
embroidery in silk and iridescent beads, which figures also on the strap.
A single paste stone forms central finish to this shoe—uncommon in shape
and design.</p>

<p class="n">The second shoe, deeper in hue, is said to have belonged to Mrs.
Grahame; and its central tongue, with two overlapping flaps, which call for
a necessary buckle of paste or silver, would place its date in the early part of
the century.</p>

<p class="n">The silver embroidery in thread, tiny sequins, beads, and lace is in
admirable taste; and the whole workmanship of the shoe, which is in
excellent preservation, is of the best order.</p>

<p class="n">The last shoe is of plain blue satin, with handsome decoration of gold
tinsel embroidery, studded with oval turquoises, and supplemented with the
brightness of crystal beads, being similar to the trimming of the dress.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig8.jpg" alt="shoes">
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Plate vii.</span></p>
</div>


<p class="c lsp large p2">Plate VIII.</p>

<p class="n"><span class="smcap large">This</span> shoe—Figure 1—bears the print of its French origin in its essential
smartness, combined with neatness and uniformity of colouring—namely, a
deep, rich purple satin, the bow being of velvet in similar shade. It was worn
by a member of the Rothschild family at the time of the Queen’s first Jubilee,
and the maker, Meier of Paris, not only has a great monopoly in the clothing
and adorning of fashionable feet, but is also much in request in successfully
fulfilling stage taste and requirements in shoes.</p>

<p class="n">The second shoe on the page is of very small size, and is of English
make, though owned and worn by the French Duchesse de Beauprémont. It
is of bright blue silk, with large rosette and peculiarly shaped heel, being much
elongated underneath towards the side seam.</p>

<p class="n">The next, pale blue silk shoe, is made simply to match a gown, and probably
out of the same fabric.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig9.jpg" alt="shoes">
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Plate viii.</span></p>
</div>


<p class="c lsp large p2">Plate IX.</p>

<p class="n"><span class="smcap large">The</span> first shoe of this plate would be remarkable for neatness, though it might
be thought somewhat spoilt by a squareness of toe, but it will be noticed the
idea of squareness appears carried out otherwise in the cut of the shoe. The
space between the principal strap and the three small ones crossing the foot
makes an uncommon variety. The little bows of twilled silk (of which the
shoe also is constructed) give a chic, if somewhat formal finish, to each band.
The heel is a Louis shape.</p>

<p class="n">Figure 2 belonged to an Edinburgh belle of the season of 1872, and is
of tiny dimensions, though the old fashion of ornamenting with a large bow
deprived the wearers of these small sizes of some of the credit.</p>

<p class="n">The third and most elegant shoe possesses one of the highest Louis heels
worn off the stage, and belonged to an American lady who, like several others,
came to this country and acquired for herself the right to the motto first
adopted by Alexander the Great—namely, “Veni, Vidi, Vici.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig10.jpg" alt="shoes">
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Plate ix.</span></p>
</div>


<p class="c lsp large p2">Plate X.</p>

<p class="n"><span class="smcap large">This</span> shoe of white silk has the novel decoration of small netted buttons.
These buttons rest on simulated straps, the silk being merely cut away to show
spaces of the blue lining between. The shoe has altogether a perfection of
style which its distinguished owner, an autocrat in dress, always demands.</p>

<p class="n">No. 2 is of very small size in white satin, richly embroidered in crystal
beads and thick silk twist. The open-work meshes, like spider webs, could
reveal a pretty shade of stocking.</p>

<p class="n">The latter idea, however, is carried out to perfection by No. 3, a shoe
which is composed entirely of strong cream silk guipure. It is eminently
fitted for evening—especially dancing—wear, both as to texture and coolness.
The pattern of the lace in this example adapts itself to the neatest and smallest
of shapes. The back is kept in shape with satin-covered stiffening.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig11.jpg" alt="shoes">
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Plate x.</span></p>
</div>


<p class="c lsp large p2">Plate XI.</p>

<p class="n"><span class="smcap large">This</span> shoe of Cromwellian shape hails from the stage, and boasts the highest
heel in the collection. It is thickly embroidered in small crystal beads studded
with cabochons, the latter also in clear crystal, which is a decoration difficult
to beat. The wide tongue is kept in place by a strap, which would require a
diamond or silver buckle to fasten it at the side, not visible in the illustration.
The lining is of pale blue satin.</p>

<p class="n">No. 2 is owned by a society belle, whose beauty may be said to extend
from “top to toe,” as the toe, or rather toes, encased in this foot-gear must be
of the smallest and daintiest description, and demanding a share of the admiration
granted to their lovely owner’s figure and face.</p>

<p class="n">The next shoe is a wedding shoe, looking strange to us in its old-world
form, but the very mould of fashion in its day, which dates nearly forty years
ago.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig12.jpg" alt="shoes">
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Plate xi.</span></p>
</div>


<p class="c lsp large p2">Plate XII.</p>

<p class="n"><span class="smcap large">A handsome</span> shoe this of rich silver brocade, with bow of same, pointed toe,
and substantial Louis heel. The incurved seam at back gives a firmer hold
to heel and ankle.</p>

<p class="n">Miss Edna May owned the centre shoe, and it was worn by her as the
“Belle of New York.” The embroidery in white silk and silver beads is
faultless in design. The heel is an extremity of height, and is much the safer
for the single ankle-strap, with its neat bow and ornament.</p>

<p class="n">No. 3, of plain silver kid, has elongated toe, beaded by small silver
ornament. It is a suitable shoe for fancy dress, but has this drawback—together
with its two companions, also much besilvered—a liability to tarnish.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig13.jpg" alt="shoes">
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Plate xii.</span></p>
</div>


<p class="c lsp large p2">Plate XIII.</p>

<p class="n"><span class="smcap large">This</span> well-shaped boot stands out unique amongst the bevy of surrounding
shoes, but its texture, shade, and workmanship are none the less delicate. Its
owner and wearer was of exalted position, and her foreign birth, perhaps,
inclined her to a departure from the usual style for evening wear.</p>

<p class="n">No. 2 shoe is of a shape frequently made in two shades, but looks no less
well for its sameness of colouring in the present instance, with which the neat
trio of steel daisies admirably harmonise, adapting it at once to modified
mourning if desired.</p>

<p class="n">Last on this page is a bridesmaid’s shoe, and it could well be taken as a
pattern of style for anyone called upon to enact that part. The bow of silk
ribbon harmonises with the heliotrope coloured satin, of which this shoe and
its two predecessors are made.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig14.jpg" alt="shoes">
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Plate xiii.</span></p>
</div>


<p class="c lsp large p2">Plate XIV.</p>

<p class="n"><span class="smcap large">First</span> appears in this shoe a further idea of contrivances for firm wear. This
is in the form of a useful elastic strap, covered with heliotrope satin bow to
match shoe. It is a more clumsy appliance than the indrawn heel at the top,
before described in Plate XII.</p>

<p class="n">The second shoe, also in heliotrope shade, but of silk, belonged to the
Comtesse de Paris, and is decorated with real lace. It has a square toe and
low heel.</p>

<p class="n">No. 3 is distinguished for its embroidery, the species of flower and the
blending of its colours harmonising so well with the lilac colour of satin.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig15.jpg" alt="shoes">
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Plate xiv.</span></p>
</div>


<p class="c lsp large p2">Plate XV.</p>

<p class="n"><span class="smcap large">First</span>, a shoe which can be certified as Imperial, and bears the French print
of good taste in elaboration. The little border of lace all round the edge and
also round the bow gives daintiness and lightness, whereas the gold embroidery
gives massive richness at the same time. The additional knot of gold lace
and tassels is peculiarly handsome and effective, and the rich embroidery and
bead work extends even to the heel—an Imperial heel evidently demanding
special adornment.</p>

<p class="n">Algiers contributes this specimen of slipper, Eastern in design and shape,
and in its lavish covering of patterned gold.</p>

<p class="n">No. 3 is another case of the evening “Oxford” shoe. It is beautifully
shaped and free from clumsiness, and the embroidery in lightness and effectiveness
of design scores a success. The Duchess who chose and wore it might
well be imitated in such a fashion.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig16.jpg" alt="shoes">
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Plate xv.</span></p>
</div>


<p class="c lsp large p2">Plate XVI.</p>

<p class="n"><span class="smcap large">The</span> first shoe on this plate belonged to and was worn by Miss Christine
Nilsson in “Lohengrin.” It is of cloth of gold, and testifies that the great singer
does not neglect, in her superior charm of voice, the additional charm of dress.
The gilt buttons are appropriate, and the crystal studs, glistening like dewdrops
across the instep, are original in arrangement. The toe is very
elongated. Otherwise the shoe is of the ordinary approved shape.</p>

<p class="n">No, 2 is gilded kid, superior to the cloth of woven gold thread from its
untarnishable quality. The round gilt button makes a neat finish. The
heel is rather low for smart effect.</p>

<p class="n">The third shoe of cloth of gold boasts a Duchess for its quondam owner,
who, in turn, can boast that her foot could grace its tiny dimensions. The
sole ornament of loops of braid is uncommon, in the fact that it is composed of
bullion and not tinsel. The shoe has a Louis heel and white kid lining.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig17.jpg" alt="shoes">
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Plate xvi.</span></p>
</div>


<p class="c lsp large p2">Plate XVII.</p>

<p class="n"><span class="smcap large">Though</span> simply severe in style (which the richness of material demands), this
shoe doubtless repeats the hue and texture of the gorgeous sweeping folds of
the costume it was made to match. The paste button is neat and good, and
too modest in size to publish its own failure in competition with the jewels due
to the rank and toilette of the wearer. The Louis heel is also velvet-covered.</p>

<p class="n">No. 2 shoe is a departure from the ordinary evening style. It must have
a firmness for dancing, which is, perhaps, advantageous in some cases. The
festooned embroidery in chain stitch and French knots is tastefully done in silk
of darker shade, and adds to the originality of the shoe. Also a feature of it
is that it is made all in one piece, and a line of stitching simulates a seam.</p>

<p class="n">The last is of watered silk. The inside lining is of delicate pink satin.
The buttoned strap is a favourite style with many—sometimes single, sometimes
multiplied, and more or less elaborate. The plain gilt button in this case alone
figures, whilst on the toe rests a small bow of watered silk ribbon exact in
shade.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig18.jpg" alt="shoes">
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Plate xvii.</span></p>
</div>


<p class="c lsp large p2">Plate XVIII.</p>

<p class="n"><span class="smcap large">1. Deep</span> eau-de-nil satin shoe worn by Miss Ada Cavendish as Lady Teazle.
Large rosette, with gilt and steel square buckle. This size of bow (now
obsolete) admitted of an elastic insertion at the back, which, no doubt, added
to the ease of fitting. The toe-cap is chain-stitched and appliqué.</p>

<p class="n">The next is similar in hue, but of modern shape. It is very finely beaded,
so fine as to readily conjure up the impression of a possible use of seed pearl.
The toe is pointed, and the heel in Louis style.</p>

<p class="n">No. 3 is also of a modern shape, the colour yellowish green. This
shoe has only a Louis heel and general neatness to distinguish it.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig19.jpg" alt="shoes">
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Plate xviii.</span></p>
</div>


<p class="c lsp large p2">Plate XIX.</p>

<p class="n"><span class="smcap large">The</span> satin Oxford shoe again appears first on this plate. It is particularly
small and neat indeed. Only the owner of a small foot could, with success,
adopt this style. It is very finely embroidered in steel beads in a floral pattern.
Louis heel, silk lace to match.</p>

<p class="n">No. 2.—A deep red shoe, with closely embroidered toe in gold thread.
It has plain silk bow to match and Louis heel.</p>

<p class="n">Deep crimson also No. 3, with embroidery of rich gold thread picked out
with white beads to emphasise the pattern. The rosette has rows of beads
alternate red and gold, on every folded edge, and in the centre several rows.
The toe is pointed; an ordinary heel.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig20.jpg" alt="shoes">
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Plate xix.</span></p>
</div>

<p class="c lsp large p2">Plate XX.</p>

<p class="n"><span class="smcap large">The</span> brocade of this first shoe is rich in colour and substance. The pattern
is well manipulated, so that the effect is good. The bow is of the same
material.</p>

<p class="n">The next shoe stands out in originality of style. The red and white satin
make a vivid contrast. The piece of red attached to the vamp is sewn to the
sole only, otherwise loose, and therefore would almost make necessary an
ornament to fix it at the top as well and give a finish.</p>

<p class="n">This shoe, the third and last, belonged to Rosa Anderson, a fair maid
of Perth, whose elopement created a great sensation in bygone days in the
town, to whose Council her husband belonged. Let us hope this actual pair
of shoes did not carry their fair owner away to a chimerical happiness from the
path of duty which appeared prosaic in the face of flattery and attention from
one whose position far exceeded that of the burgher’s wife.</p>

<p class="n"><span class="smcap large">Dancing</span> sandals worn in the ballet by Madame Cerri, made of pink satin
with pink satin ties. The soles very small, and the padded toes protruding
considerably beyond them.</p>
